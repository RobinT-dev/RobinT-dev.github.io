## 💭 Motivation

### The Problem

Let's be honest: school can be overwhelming. Between competitive environments, mounting exam pressure, parental expectations, and the constant struggle with procrastination and time management, many students experience burnout. The grind for grades often leaves little room for passion, hobbies, or even just breathing space.

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

### The Solution

I started techxgirls to prove something important: Learning doesn't have to be stressful.

With the right approach, anyone can adopt an efficient, low-stress, consistent study routine—and actually have time left over for the things that matter. This platform shares practical lessons, quick tutorials, and actionable study strategies that work in the real world, not just in theory.

### My Story

Hi! I'm a 14-year-old student at Raffles Girls' School, Singapore. I'm passionate about English Literature, STEM subjects, debate, softball, and badminton. I created this platform during my school holiday while exploring coding and sci-fi—proof that you don't need to sacrifice your interests to succeed academically.

I want to share what I've learned: that learning can be exciting, lifelong, and—dare I say—fun. This holiday project is my way of paying it forward to fellow students navigating the same challenges I face every day.
